I'm currently the Director of Microsoft's Open Source Programs Office.  That means I help drive open source culture, policies, processes and tools across the company.  Check out [Microsoft's open source work](https://opensource.microsoft.com).  Of course, the opinions here are my own and no, I'm not a lawyer.

When not doing open source stuff, you can find me with the family or working on/driving [my Pro3 race car](http://pro3-racing.com).
